# Test Script Organization Summary

This document summarizes the reorganization of test scripts created during the dashboard UI improvements.

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Moved to Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/test_dashboard.py`)
Added comprehensive unit tests for new dashboard functionality:

- **`test_text_wrapping_functionality`**: Tests the `_wrap_text()` utility method with various text lengths and indentation
- **`test_terminal_width_adaptation`**: Tests dynamic terminal width detection and bounds checking (60-140 chars)
- **`test_activity_formatting_alignment`**: Tests that activity entries maintain proper column alignment across different emotional state lengths

### 2. **Created Demo Script** (`demos/dashboard_text_wrapping_demo.py`)
Interactive demonstration script that showcases:

- Text wrapping with proper alignment
- Column alignment across different emotional state names
- Dynamic terminal resizing capabilities
- Full text visibility (no truncation)
- Real-time refresh to demonstrate terminal size adaptation

### 3. **Cleaned Up Temporary Files**
Removed temporary test scripts that were created during development:

- `test_dashboard_wrapping.py` → Converted to demo
- `alignment_test.py` → Logic incorporated into unit tests
- `quick_test.py` → Removed (no longer needed)
- `debug_alignment.py` → Removed (debug only)
- `simple_alignment_test.py` → Removed (debug only)

## 🧪 Running the Tests

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all dashboard unit tests
./run_tests_venv.sh tests/unit/test_dashboard.py::TestLiveDashboard

# Run specific test
./run_tests_venv.sh tests/unit/test_dashboard.py::TestLiveDashboard::test_text_wrapping_functionality
```

### Demo
```bash
# Run the interactive demo
python3 demos/dashboard_text_wrapping_demo.py
```

## 📋 Test Coverage

The new unit tests cover:

- ✅ Text wrapping utility function
- ✅ Terminal width adaptation and bounds checking
- ✅ Column alignment verification
- ✅ Multi-line text formatting
- ✅ Proper indentation handling

## 🎯 Key Features Tested

1. **Text Wrapping**: Long text properly wraps to multiple lines with correct alignment
2. **Column Alignment**: Pipes (`|`) stay aligned regardless of emotional state name length
3. **Terminal Resizing**: Display adapts to terminal width changes in real-time
4. **Full Text Display**: Complete text used for analysis is visible (no truncation)
5. **Robust Formatting**: Consistent layout across different content lengths

## 📁 File Organization

```
tests/
├── unit/
│   └── test_dashboard.py          # Added 3 new unit tests
demos/
└── dashboard_text_wrapping_demo.py # Interactive demo script
```

This organization follows the project's testing conventions and makes the functionality easily testable and demonstrable.
